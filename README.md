Note: only works in terminals that support ANSI escape codes (should work in those that don't too but you would not be able to discern anything happening on screen)

Game is snake, you guide the green line (it's a snake) to red dots (apples, or food) and every time snake eats, it gets longer, this starts to become a problem as snake gets too long.

keyboard controls:
* w: up
* a: left
* s: down
* d: right
* p: pause
* k: confirm

game is coded entirely in C, rlutil.h was used for inputs.
Made during the summer of 2024.
